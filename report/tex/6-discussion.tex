\section{The data}
    Several issues arose once starting working with the data. A problem which most likely is relevant to most industries today is that having data is far from having good data. Everyone has heard about the importance of data, and the big data buzzword. Starting working with the thesis, having an enourmous $90Gb$ of data available seemed like way to much. However as the work progressed, it was discoverered that there were several issues with the data. 
    
    This shows the importance of knowledge about data anlysis when starting to store data. To enable utlization of all the machine learninge techniques that are avialbe today, one need good data. This is also were this thesis is far from much of the work done in machine learning. Most papers are produced using artificial data, that is on the format needed for each algorithm. In the real world, this might not be the case. 
    
    \subsection{Improvements}
    
    \subsection{Third party}
        mention the issue when working with a third party, comunication, sampling etc. Simpler if one has sampled the data one is working self. Then there should not be any surprises arising as the data is explored. This was a big issue with the dataset used in this thesis. 
\section{Performance of the algorithms}
