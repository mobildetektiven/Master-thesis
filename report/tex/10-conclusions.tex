%
This is a summary of the results of the report, and here you also describe future work (either what you are going to do in your MSc project work, or what you would do if you had 6 more months to work on this topic.)












\section{Conclusion}


\section{Further work}
    get data with even sampling rate to test performance with more variables available
    talk to energy companies, how would they want such a system to behave?
    look into how to visualise the data 
    feature selection methods once one get samples that are even 
    try to combine the work from the project and master thesis to see how one can create a system more independt of the plant setup. 
    
    Data from this plant could be used to generalize the anomaly detectors to any combination of needles, but this will not be covered in this thesis.
