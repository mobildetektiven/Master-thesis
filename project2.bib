abstract = {We analyze a class of estimators based on convex relaxation for solving high-dimensional matrix decomposition problems. The observations are noisy realizations of a linear transformation {\$}\backslashmathfrak{\{}X{\}}{\$} of the sum of an approximately) low rank matrix {\$}\backslashTheta{\^{}}\backslashstar{\$} with a second matrix {\$}\backslashGamma{\^{}}\backslashstar{\$} endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure; this set-up includes many statistical models of interest, including factor analysis, multi-task regression, and robust covariance estimation. We derive a general theorem that bounds the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair {\$}(\backslashTheta{\^{}}\backslashstar, \backslashGamma{\^{}}\backslashstar){\$} obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that combines the nuclear norm with a general decomposable regularizer. Our results utilize a "spikiness" condition that is related to but milder than singular vector incoherence. We specialize our general result to two cases that have been studied in past work: low rank plus an entrywise sparse matrix, and low rank plus a columnwise sparse matrix. For both models, our theory yields non-asymptotic Frobenius error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and applies to matrices {\$}\backslashTheta{\^{}}\backslashstar{\$} that can be exactly or approximately low rank, and matrices {\$}\backslashGamma{\^{}}\backslashstar{\$} that can be exactly or approximately sparse. Moreover, for the case of stochastic noise matrices and the identity observation operator, we establish matching lower bounds on the minimax error. The sharpness of our predictions is confirmed by numerical simulations.},

abstract = {Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to read another person's mind. To apply ToM in robots, robot should read the intention from target. However, it is difficult to read target's intention directly. Robot uses the sensors to measure distance from target because distance is the feature to read target's intention. Neural network has been widely used to control the robot for generating a diverse speciation. It has been less explored in behavior-based robotics. Speciation usually relies on a distance measure that allows different from the robot to target to be compared. In this paper, we proposed novel measure to generate diverse behaviors of a robot with speciation for ToM. It includes some distance measure such as Euclidean distance, cosine distance, arctangent distance, and edit distance. It generates diverse behaviors of the robot by neural network for ToM. The proposed method has been experimented on a real e-puck robot platform. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Stiction is a common problem in spring-diaphragm type valves, which are widely used in the process industry. Although there have been many attempts to understand and detect stiction in control valves, none of the current methods can simultaneously detect and quantify stiction. Conventional invasive methods such as the valve travel test can easily detect stiction, but are expensive and tedious to apply to hundreds of valves to detect stiction. Thus there is a clear need in the process industry for a non-invasive method that can not only detect but also quantify stiction so that the valves that need repair or maintenance can be identified, isolated and repaired. This work describes a model free method that can detect and quantify stiction that may be present in control valves using routine operating data obtained from the process. No additional excitation or experimentation of the plant is required. Over a dozen industrial case studies have demonstrated the wide applicability and practicality of this method as an useful diagnostic aid in control loop performance monitoring. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an autoen-coder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA and kernel PCA to clarify its property. The artificial data is generated from Lorenz system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data. This paper demonstrates that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails. Also, autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising au-toenconders. Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as non-linear techniques without complex computation as kernel PCA requires. Finaly, the authors examine the learned fea-tures in the hidden layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly and activate differently with anomalous input.},

@article{Gola2012,
abstract = {Abstract In oil and gas industries, drilling is a complex and critical operation which require constant and accurate real-time monitoring. To this aim, real-time models are required to provide an overview of the drilling operations when direct and reliable measurements are not available. Given the harsh operating environment, sensor reliability and calibration are critical issues and bad data quality is a typical problem which affects the accuracy of the model. As a result, the driller may be misled about the down-hole situation or receive conflicting claims about operating conditions. This paper presents two approaches based on the use of artificial intelligence to improve monitoring of drilling processes in terms of reduced uncertainty and increased confidence. The first exploits the aggregation of the opinion of different experts within a so-called ensemble approach; the second is based on a so-called grey-box approach which combines a physical model and artificial intelligence. The two approaches are applied to the problem of predicting the bottom-hole pressure during a managed pressure drilling operation to demonstrate the improved accuracy and robustness. 1. Introduction A major critical task when starting the exploitation of a new well is the process of drilling the borehole. Drilling is a close-loop process in which the drilling fluid is pumped into the drill pipe at a pressure enough to cause it to circulate downwardly through the drill pipe, the drill collars, the bit nozzles and upwardly through the annulus between the borehole and the drill pipe back to the surface where it goes through a reconditioning process and is finally re-circulated through the pipes. The purpose of the drilling fluid is to remove rock and sediment fragments produced by the bit during drilling, to transport them to the surface, to cool the bit and to maintain pressure balance against the pressure in the rock formation. For these reasons, it is critical to ensure a constant fluid inlet at the right pressure at all time. A sudden loss of drilling fluid would lead in fact to built-up of rock fragments which, if not detected at an early stage, might lead to much worse situations such as stuck drill pipes, bit failures, drill string twist-off and more, resulting in significant non-productive time due to dangerous fishing trips or, in the worst cases, in the loss of expensive bottom-hole assemblies, potentially in the loss of the entire well and even in blowouts with extreme consequences like large financial losses, severe environmental damages and possible loss of lives. Given the critical role played by the drilling fluid especially in maintaining the correct pressure balance, control systems are adopted to regulate the drilling fluid influx with the purpose of precisely controlling the pressure profiles throughout the well hole. This paper focuses on the so-called Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) system. The objectives of MPD are to ascertain the well bottom-hole pressure environment limits and to accordingly maintain the annular hydraulic pressure profile within its boundaries, i.e. above the pore pressure of the reservoir or the collapse pressure of the borehole and below the fracturing pressure of the borehole eventually responding rapidly to undesired events. Failure to maintain the correct pressure can for instance result in loss of drilling fluid to the formation or unexpected reservoir influxes (especially gas) which in the worst case scenario can lead to surface blowouts. A simplified model of the MPD control system is sketched in Figure 1. For a detailed description of the MPD system refer to [1].},

Machine learning is used in Web search, spam filters, recommender systems, ad placement, credit scoring, fraud detection, stock trading, drug design, and many other applications. A recent report from the McKinsey Global Institute asserts that machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation. Several fine textbooks are available to interested practitioners and researchers (for example, Mitchell and Witten et al.). However, much of the ‚Äúfolk knowledge‚Äù that is needed to successfully develop machine learning applications is not readily available in them. As a result, many machine learning projects take much longer than necessary or wind up producing less-than-ideal results. Yet much of this folk knowledge is fairly easy to communicate.

abstract = {Suppose you are given some data set drawn from an underlying probability distribution P and you want to estimate a "simple" subset S of input space such that the probability that a test point drawn from P lies outside of S equals some a priori specified value between 0 and 1. We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

@book{ChristopherM.Bishop,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints.

abstract = {Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on a variety of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random ‚Äúdropout‚Äù procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid overÔ¨Åtting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectiÔ¨Åed linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modiÔ¨Åed deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2{\%} relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4{\%} relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system. We were able to obtain our results with minimal human hyper-parameter tuning using publicly available Bayesian optimization code},

@article{BergstraJAMESBERGSTRA2012,
abstract = {Grid search and manual search are the most widely used strategies for hyper-parameter optimiza-tion. This paper shows empirically and theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a compar-ison with a large previous study that used grid search and manual search to configure neural net-works and deep belief networks. Compared with neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we find that random search over the same domain is able to find models that are as good or better within a small fraction of the computation time. Granting random search the same computational budget, random search finds better models by effectively searching a larger, less promising con-figuration space. Compared with deep belief networks configured by a thoughtful combination of manual search and grid search, purely random search over the same 32-dimensional configuration space found statistically equal performance on four of seven data sets, and superior performance on one of seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function from hyper-parameters to validation set performance reveals that for most data sets only a few of the hyper-parameters really matter, but that different hyper-parameters are important on different data sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor choice for configuring algorithms for new data sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent " High Throughput " methods achieve surprising success‚Äîthey appear to search through a large number of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest in large hierarchical models will place an increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter optimization; this work shows that random search is a natural base-line against which to judge progress in the development of adaptive (sequential) hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},
